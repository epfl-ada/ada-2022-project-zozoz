# Is John the reason for the success? A deep dive of the temporal changes in movie


## Abstract üìù [Aamir]
The CMU movie [dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) comes from 42,306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia. We want to assess what makes a movie successful. Success has different dimensions. We are using the box office and IMDB ratings to cover the two important ones. We take into account attributes like genres, actors, directors, character names etc. and want to analyse their contribution to the success of a movie. We want to see if we can find temporal changes in the data and create a blueprint for the next big hit.

## Research Questions üß†
- What makes a movie successful across the years?
    - What characteristics do they need to have for example director, actors, genres or character names?
- Can we cluster successful movie plots?
- Are the reasons for success and their evolution the same across countries?
- Can we create our own blueprint the next big hit?

## Proposed additional datasets üì†
- Wikipedia
  - Why? To complete missing release date values in our initial dataset.
  - How? Using the wikipedia python library, we were able to retrieve page information for many movies.
- IMDb
  - Why? To have more metadata for movies such as directors, music producers, ratings.
  - How? Using the IMDB public datasets and filtering the movies to keep only the ones that are in the CMU dataset.


## Methods ü§ñ

### 1. Data Model ùå≠
To get a better understanding of our data, we first build a relational model and format data according to it.

First, we decided to have two tables, `Actor` and `Movie`. Both tables contain the IDs needed to recognize the different movies and actors, as well as other attributes describing the elements. The "appears_in" table makes the link between movies and actors who play in them by also specifying the age of the actors at the time the movie was released. There is also a table for characters in movies, defined by their IDs as well as their names. All movies have characters, all characters belong to a certain movie. All actors play/dub characters, but not all characters are necessarily played by actors (T-Rex in Jurassic Park). It is important to note that we defined our relationships between tables by logic, not by checking the data, as it was before we started working with it.

Finally, there are three more tables providing information about movies, `country`, `is_of_type` and `spoken_languages`. We have separated these tables from the `movie` table since a movie can be linked to several elements in these different tables. We have described the links as complete for all except the link between `movie` and `spoken_language` since movies do not necessarily have a spoken_language (silent movies).

All the dataframes are [here](/data/generated/).



### 2. Data Wrangling ü•ã
#### Missing data
#### Incorrect data?

### 3. Data Analysis üìà
- Time series analysis
- Clustering
